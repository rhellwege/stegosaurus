- multi byte adaptive arithmetic coding
- implement rle lzss compressors
- optimise bwt further (modify sais for cyclic string comparisons)
- optimise with rayon wherever possible
- optimise the bitstream

why 16 bit int max block size
why rle encoder decoder doesntwork
why bwt original index bits only works on bytes
read into buf is not guaranteed to request the number of bytes in the vector
