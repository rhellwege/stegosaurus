- multi byte adaptive arithmetic coding
- arithmetic coding as an entropy coding needs a symbol space api (u16 instead of u8)
- make whole process lazyily streamable to create composable pipelines - in practice this means implementing read on the state structure of a decoder struct or an encoder struct
- implement bwt (with move-to-front + rle) or lzss compressors
